# Emergency Fire Response Edmonton

- City fire departments need to understand response times, event duration, neighbourhood risk, and resource utilization to improve emergency response and staffing decisions

This project is going to be an end-to-end ETL pipeline that ingests Edmonton's fire incident data, transforms and validates it, loads it into PostgreSQL, and visualizes emergency response performance using Power BI.
This could tell us where resources could be allocated more effectively if more were to open up.

This project uses publicly available municipal fire incident data.
Due to file size limitations, raw CSV files are not included in the repository.

Data can be downloaded from:
- City Open Data Portal
